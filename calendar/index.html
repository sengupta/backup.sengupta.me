        <h2>How to use this</h2>

        <h3>Google Calendar</h3>

        <p>There are several ways you can interact with this calendar. The preferred way to use this is to add this calendar to your Google Calendar Account by using the "+ Google Calendar" button at the bottom of the embedded calendar. Once you do that, this calendar will integrate with your Google Calendar. Thereafter, you can set that calendar to sync with your phone if you have it set up to sync with your Google Calendar account.  </p>

        <p> After you add this calendar to your Google Calendar account, you should check your notification settings. If you do not check your Google Calendar account regularly, you may miss out on events. You can have your Google Calendar send you email notifications of new events and reminders for existing events according to your personal preferences.  You will find this under your Calender Settings, under the Calendars tab- through "Aditya Sengupta's Public Calendar", under the Notifications tab. You can even choose to receive SMS notifications if you set your phone up with Google Calendar. Alternatively, you can have it send you a daily agenda of events (during that day).  </p>

        <h3>Alternatives to Google Calendar</h3>

            Let me know that you are using this. 
            </li>
            <li> Let me know if you're going to attend an event on this calendar. </li>
            <li>If you find out about an event that you think might be a god fit for this calendar (any event you think might interest me), let me know. </li>

        </ol>

        I'll only remain motivated enough to use this if I know <em>you</em> are using this.
